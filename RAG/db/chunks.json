Because the average half life of a red blood cell is sixty days, HbA1c has been accepted as a measurement which reflects the mean\n          daily blood glucose concentration, better than fasting blood glucose determination, and the degree of carbohydrate imbalance over the preceding\n          two months.                                                             \n        \u2022 It may also provide a better index of control of the diabetic patient without resorting to glucose loading procedures.\n      HbA1c assay Interferences:                                                  \n      Erroneous values might be obtained from samples with abnormally elevated quantities of other Haemoglobins as a result of\n      either their simultaneous elution with HbA1c (HbF) or differences in their glycation from that of HbA (HbS).\n      Reference: ADA Guideline 2023                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       DR.TEJASWINI DHOTE         Dr. Sanjeev Shah         Dr.Yash Shah           \n       M.D. Pathology             MD Path                  MD Path                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                      Page 5 of 19\n                                  This is an Electronically Authenticated Report. # Referred Test\nelaM-sraeY                                                                        \n14-arupmoS                                                                        \nkidraH                                                                            \n.rM-621006123220", "--- PAGE 6 TEXT ---\nMC-2202                      \n                                           Scan QR code to check                  \n                                            report authenticity                   \n       Passport No :           LABORATORY TEST REPORT                             \n           Patient Information    Sample Information        Client/Location Information\n       Name : Lyubochka Svetka Lab Id : 02232160XXXX Client Name : Sterling Accuris Buddy\n                              Registration on : 20-Feb-2023 09:10                 \n                                                  Location :                      \n       Sex/Age : Male / 41 Y 01-Feb-1982 Collected at : non SAWPL                 \n                                                  Approved on : 20-Feb-2023 11:38 Status : Final\n       Ref.

If there is\n       discrepancy, a third specimen is recommended. When 2 out of 3 results are in the microalbuminuria range, this is evidence for incipient nephropathy\n       and warrants increased efforts at glucose control, blood pressure control, and institution of therapy with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)\n       inhibitor (if the patient can tolerate it).                                \n       Reference :                                                                \n         1.

Vitamin D deficiency is not clear. Levels needed to prevent rickets and osteomalacia (15 ng/mL) are lower\n       than those that dramatically suppress parathyroid hormone levels (20\u201330 ng/mL). In turn, those levels are lower than levels needed to optimize intestinal\n       calcium absorption (34 ng/mL). Neuromuscular peak performance is associated with levels approximately 38 ng/mL. A recent study states that\n       increasing mean baseline levels from 29 to 38 ng/mL was associated with a 50% lower risk for colon cancer and levels of 52 ng/mL with a 50% reduction\n       in the incidence of breast cancer.

A PROVISIONALITY REACTIVE / BORDERLINE REACTIVE result suggests possibility of HIV-1 or/and HIV-2 infection. However these results\n          must be verified by confirmatory WESTERN BLOT / HIV PCR method before declaring the patient positive for HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection.\n       3. Very high levels of IgM Antibodies or Anti-HLA ABC and DR Antibodies can give false positive reaction.\n      **Pre & Post test counselling for HIV testing is responsibility of reffering Physician.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Dr. Siddharth Thummar      Dr. Sanjeev Shah         Dr.Yash Shah           \n       M.D. Pathology             MD Path                  MD Path                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                      Page 16 of 19\n                                  This is an Electronically Authenticated Report. # Referred Test\nelaM-sraeY                                                                        \n14-arupmoS                                                                        \nkidraH                                                                            \n.rM-621006123220", "--- PAGE 17 TEXT ---\nMC-2202                      \n                                           Scan QR code to check                  \n                                            report authenticity                   \n       Passport No :           LABORATORY TEST REPORT                             \n           Patient Information    Sample Information        Client/Location Information\n       Name : Lyubochka Svetka Lab Id : 02232160XXXX Client Name : Sterling Accuris Buddy\n                              Registration on : 20-Feb-2023 09:10                 \n                                                  Location :                      \n       Sex/Age : Male / 41 Y 01-Feb-1982 Collected at : non SAWPL                 \n                                                  Approved on : 20-Feb-2023 14:16 Status : Final\n       Ref.
